# Image-Recognition-Tutorial-using-MXNet-with-Docker
This is an extension of the tutorial available at https://www.r-bloggers.com/image-recognition-tutorial-in-r-using-deep-convolutional-neural-networks-mxnet-package/ for image recognition example using MXNet. The users can easily build a docker image for the required environment and directly start running the example. There is no need to do installation of linux and other required packages.

This is just started.....
I am still working on it......
